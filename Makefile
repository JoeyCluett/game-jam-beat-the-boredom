# built on x86_64 system running Ubuntu 16.04 LTS
# SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer) is used as the graphics API
# the main build command below links with the SDL dynamic library
#
# links against SDL version 1.2.15
#
# NOTE: I am aware that the general consensus is that SDL1.2 is old 
# and deprecated and we should all be using SDL2. however, most of 
# my experience is with SDL1.2 and I am already familiar with the API
